Tae Kwon Do is a version of an ancient form of self-defense practiced for many centuries in the Orient. It originated and perfected in its present form in Korea. Over the last one hundred years, Korea has organized many forms of martial arts and made Tae Kwon Do the national martial art form.   </br>
	Tae Kwon Do is now recognized as an Official Olympic Sport. Tae Kwon Do requires no weapon to practice and is never used to attack others. It should only be used as an option for self-defense.   </br>
	In the beginning, students learn to develop their strength, coordination, agility and conditioning, which is essential in executing self-defense movements. As a student advances, the instruction focuses on mental development. Through concentration, the student is taught to channel energy through the body and harness it into the most effective method of defense and do so without fear.

Grandmaster Park is a 9th degree Black Belt which means he is a Grandmaster in Tae Kwon Do. Born in Korea, Grandmaster Park attained not only his Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do, but also learned the extreme form of self-defense technique, Kuk Ki Do. Once in the United States, he became one of the top ten figures in the country, and the team that he was a member of became number one in the world.   </br>
	Master Castillo’s traditional curriculum focuses on the true disciplines of martial arts training: Respect, Focus, Positive Attitude, Self-Esteem, Discipline, and Perseverance. 



</br>
<p>Tae Kwon Do students develop 
</br>
<b> .A deep, personal respect for their physical ability. </br>
.Confidence that enables them to ignore threats of aggression that could lead to physical confrontation. </b>
</br>
	Parents who enroll their children in classes to protect them against school or neighborhood bullies report that their youngsters overcome problems without showdowns. 
</br>
The child’s newly developed sense of self-esteem makes him or her unlikely target for being picked on. If they are given no choice, students become more than capable of handling themselves in any situation. 
</br><b>
Children become more alert. 
They develop a positive self-image. 
They develop willingness to try harder in the classroom, which transfers to better grades. 
Kids have increased attention span & motor skills.</br>
They are better equipped and are more willing to start and finish tasks, both in the classroom and at home. </b>

</br>
	Finally children who act out negatively, learn respect for themselves, parents, and elders. Boys and girls learn self-discipline that encourages them toward successful achievement. Tae Kwon Do can unlock new sources of energy and enthusiasm. Children who are listless, bored, or lagging behind the group enjoy increased confidence, focus, and clear thinking.
